Easiest WP Plugin to manage email notifications for common events such as user's post comments.

== Description ==

Easy to setup and get the ball rolling, you just need to fill out the common email config fields as any other webmail client

**Works also for private providers like AWS SES**
*After that you can just select the desired evens to be notified about and that's it*

Manage everything from a single and very dynamic admin screen in your dashboard and get the plugin working just in a few minutes

Just install it and then do directly into Settings / WP Simple Notify to see all the options. Enjoy it!
